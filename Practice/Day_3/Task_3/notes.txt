1. **Creating a File**:
   - **Objective**: Create a new file and write some text to it.
   - **Explanation**: You use a function to create a file in a specified directory (`Crud`) and write the text "This Is A Simple File" to it. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

2. **Reading the File with Buffer**:
   - **Objective**: Read the contents of the file and understand the buffer representation.
   - **Explanation**: When you read the file, you first see a `Buffer` object, which is a way of handling binary data in Node.js. The buffer contains the raw binary data of the file. To get the readable text, you use another function that decodes this buffer into a string. You’ll see the file's contents as a string output.

3. **Updating the File**:
   - **Objective**: Append new text to the existing file.
   - **Explanation**: You add additional text ("And This Is A Demo.txt File") to the file that already contains the initial text. After appending the new text, you receive a confirmation message indicating that the file has been updated.

4. **Renaming the File** (Note: This is not part of CRUD operations but related to file management):
   - **Objective**: Change the file’s name.
   - **Explanation**: You rename the file from `Demo.txt` to `Update.txt`. This action changes the file's name while keeping the file’s contents intact. You get a confirmation message when the renaming is successful.

5. **Deleting the File**:
   - **Objective**: Remove the file from the directory.
   - **Explanation**: You delete the file that was renamed to `Update.txt`. Once deleted, the file is removed from the filesystem and no longer exists in the directory.

These steps cover basic file operations: creating, reading, updating, renaming, and deleting files. Each operation involves different functions and methods to manipulate files in Node.js.
